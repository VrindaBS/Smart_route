# Smart Route –  AI-Based Approach for Congestion Control

Smart Route is an AI-powered system that uses computer vision to detect traffic congestion using CCTV feeds. The system helps optimize urban mobility by classifying congestion levels and suggesting alternative routes dynamically.

## Features
- video frame analysis from live CCTV feeds
- Congestion classification into five levels
- Pretrained convolutional neural network for efficient processing
- Route optimization suggestions based on congestion levels

## Tech Stack
- Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras
- Video dataset for training and evaluation

## How It Works
1. Traffic video datasets were used to extract frames.
2. Congestion levels were manually labeled across five categories.
3. A convolutional model was trained to classify traffic levels.
4. The trained model was then used on real-time feeds to predict congestion.
5. Based on predictions, less congested routes are recommended.
